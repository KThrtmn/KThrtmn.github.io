                    <h2>Repetition</h2>

                    <p><a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a></p>

                    
                        <img src="/img/target-repetition.JPG" alt="target-repetition">
                        <p>
                            Target is a perfect example of repetition. Target's website uses this design principle by
                            using repeating elements such as colors, shapes.
                            For example, the target uses the same color and tints from the target logo.
                            Target integrates a color pallet which is noted as soon as you land on the home page. Red,
                            darker red, white, and grey.
                            Target also uses repeating shapes like circles when showcasing featured deals. This circle
                            can be originally found from the target logo.

            <header>
                
                    <h2>Alignment</h2>

                   <p><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/">Goulet Pen</a></p>
                
                
                    <img src="/img/gouletPen-alignment.JPG" alt="gouletPen-alignment" />
                    <p>
                        Goulet pen is a good example of alignment. When you land on their webpage you can almost notice
                        a grid where everything aligns.
                        This website does a good job of letting the pictures say the words letting them use fewer words.
                        This allows Goulet pens to have more space for aligning items.
                        I also feel that this website is a good example of white space and clean design.

        <div>
            <header>
                
                    <h3>White Space & Clean Design</h3>

                  <p>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a></p>
                
                    <img src="/img/dribble-whiteSpace.JPG" alt="dribble-whiteSpace">
                    <p>
                        Dribbble is uses padding making its website look more spacious which in turn makes the website
                        have white space.
                        This white space makes everything flow well. The color palette they chose allows for artists to
                        work to show off rather than the website.
                        The creators of the website were thoughtful in that.
