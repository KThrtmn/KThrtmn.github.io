            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <p>
                <b>What is the age of your person?</b>
                <br>
                The age of my person would be later 20's to early 40's.
                <br>
                <b>What is the gender of your person?</b>
                <br>
                Both Female and Male, this website has the potential to skew
                towards females more since they may be more likely to plan a trip a head of time.
                <br>
                <b>What is the highest level of education this person has received?</b>
                <br>
                I could see people of all walks of life using this website. Though I believe that
                more people with a minimum of some college would use this website.
                <br>
            </p>


            <h2>Professional</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <b> How much work experience does your person have?</b>
                <br>
                I would assume this person would have a minimum of several years of work
                experience under there belt to be able to afford a vacation out of the country. Assuming we are
                talking about tourists.
                <br>
                <b>Why will they come to the site? (User needs, interests, and goals)
                    Where (or from whom) else is this person getting information about your issue or similar programs or
                    services?</b>
                <br>
                They would be using this website because they would be unfamiliar with the island. They would use the
                this to
                plan their trip a head of time. They may get information by word when they are on the island.
                <br>
                <b>When and where will users access the site? (User environment and context)</b>
                <br>
                They would be mostly be using this website by mobile, especially once they are on the island. So it is
                important
                that this website is responsive.
                <br>
